<!-- tips to improve score -->
    //act
    <string name="tips1"><a href="http://www.actstudent.org/sampletest">ACT Student Practice Test</a>\n\nTake each section of the practice test individually, untimed. </string>
    <string name="tips2">Have a notebook and pencil handy for notes on questions you get wrong.\n\nTake each section of the test without time and in one sitting.</string>
    <string name="tips3">1) Click your choice for the answer on each question\n\n2) Write the number of the questions you don\'t get correct\n(i.e. Passage 3 Question 5)</string>
    <string name="tips4">3) Read and understand the pop up of the explanation of why it is incorrect and answer the question again.\n\n4) When you get the question correct, take notes on the pop up that explains the correct answer.</string>
    <string name="tips5">5) Once you have completed the practice test on ACT.org for one subject (i.e. English), do not move on to the next subject</string>
    <string name="tips6">6) Keep the notes you took handy for after you determine your score.</string>
    <string name="tips7">Scoring the Test\n\n1) Score the test by determining the number of questions you got correct.</string>
    <string name="tips8">2) Then divide the number of questions you got correct by the total number of questions.</string>
    <string name="tips9">3) For example: I got 57 questions right. There are 75 total questions.\nSo 56 / 75 = 0.76. Then multiply that number by 36. The answer you get is your score.  The score should be between 1 &amp; 36. (For example: 36 * 0.76 = 27.)</string>
    <string name="tips10">4) Now retake the same test according to the required time and repeat steps</string>
    <string name="tips11">5) If you do not reach the minimum score set by the exam administrators, thoroughly review and understand the notes you took on the incorrect answers before you retake the test timed.</string>
